You may use `~/.vimrc.before` for settings like the __leader__ setting.
You may `~/.vimrc.after` (for those transitioning from janus) or in `~/.kdr/vim/after/.vimrc.after` for any additional overrides/settings.
If you didn't have janus before, it is recommended to just put it in `~/.kdr/vim/after` so you can better manage your overrides.
